## Project - VEHICLE DETECTION APPLICATION

### Team: Akshay Penmatcha, Priyanshi Singh, Sunny Kulkarni

**Project Objective -**

Build a Traffic Tracking application to detect vehicles using city camera feeds. Objective is to identify and analyze slow-traffic junctions in the city. Used feature extraction and machine learning techniques.

Explored deep learning approach and applied below 2 shallow learning techniques for feature extraction -

1. Object Detection using HOG Features and SVM Classifier.  
2. Object Detection using HAAR Wavelets and Cascade Classifier.

Trained model with a sample image using image processing and machine learning techniques.
