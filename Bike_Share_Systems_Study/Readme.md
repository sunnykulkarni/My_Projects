## TRAVEL PATTERNS AND CORRELATION STUDY


**Team: Zhaohong Niu, Sunny Kulkarni and Chenxi Cui**

**Project Idea -**

The objective of our report is to do a base study of the existing bike sharing systems and identify patterns towards solving the bike and spots imbalance problem.

As part of our study, we - 

1. Analysed the citibike station location and its proximity to the subway stations.
  
2. Studied the riders trip data for other bike sharing systems for different locations in US to gain insights into the bike riderâ€™s behavior.
